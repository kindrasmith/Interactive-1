        I chose the Article: The Point of Data Collection, DataSociety.net. This article talks about how how to Algorithm is a biased and unfair system that overlooks information. The article explains how the algorithm takes certain pieces of information that it is given such as your name, birthday, what you have liked, etc. and makes an overall ussumption and makes a summary of who you are and what you like. One of the most recognized forms is how the algorithm sends specific things onto your facebook or instagram feed when you are scrolling through. I thought an interesting point of this article was when it stated that is was biased. It is true, I just had never thought of it in that way. On my Instagram, I have a lot of food videos pop up. It made me think, what if there was a site that took all of the food pictures, videos and ubereats food that you have ordered or liked, and mashed it all together to create a super-food that the algorithm knows that you will like.
